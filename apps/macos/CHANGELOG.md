# Changelog

All notable changes to the Moltis macOS app will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Real-time session sync with web UI — sessions created, deleted, or patched in
  the web UI now instantly appear in the macOS sidebar (and vice versa) via the
  new `SessionEventBus` and `moltis_set_session_event_callback` FFI
- Full Moltis gateway in the HTTP Server pane — starts the complete gateway
  (web UI, REST API, WebSocket endpoints, DB migrations, background services)
  instead of a minimal health-check-only server
- Bind address picker (Loopback / All interfaces) replacing the free-text host field
- Progress spinner during gateway startup (DB migrations can take 1-3s)
- Async server startup dispatched off the main thread to keep the UI responsive
- Model picker labels now show context size and tier badges
- Provider model list sorting by context window size
- Identity loaded from `moltis.toml` + `SOUL.md` at startup via new
  `moltis_get_identity` FFI — Settings→Identity now shows agent name, emoji,
  theme, user name, and soul
- Version loaded on app launch via `chatStore.loadVersion()`
- Persistent session storage via FFI — sessions backed by JSONL files shared
  with the web UI and TUI (no longer ephemeral in-memory arrays)
- Session CRUD FFI functions: `moltis_list_sessions`, `moltis_switch_session`,
  `moltis_create_session`, `moltis_session_chat_stream`
- Session sidebar now loads from disk and shows message counts
- Chat messages are persisted to `~/.moltis/data/sessions/<key>.jsonl`
- "Open in Browser" button in HTTP Server pane when the gateway is running

### Changed

- Session metadata now stored in SQLite (`moltis.db`) instead of JSON file,
  so the macOS app and web UI share the same session list

- HTTP Server description updated to reflect full gateway capability
- Server start/stop controls disabled while startup is in progress
- Chat is no longer tied to HTTP server — works with or without HTTPD enabled

### Fixed

- Bind address picker and port field now visible before enabling HTTP server
  (previously hidden inside the enable-toggle conditional block)
