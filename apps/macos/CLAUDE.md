# macOS App Guidelines

The macOS app should match the Moltis web UI (`crates/web/src/assets/`) in layout, behavior, and visual style. When implementing a feature, refer to the web UI as the source of truth for how it should look and work. Use native macOS/SwiftUI controls but keep the same information hierarchy, spacing, and flow.

## Changelog

Update `CHANGELOG.md` in this directory when making user-facing changes to the macOS app. Follow [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) format with sections: Added, Changed, Fixed, Removed.
